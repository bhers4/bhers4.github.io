	<h2>Research Co-op @ <a href="https://www.cadex.com/en/">Cadex Electronics Inc.</a></h2>
	<h5> January 2018-December 2018</h5>
	
	<h3>Lithium Ion Battery State of Health Classification using Machine Learning</h3>
	<h5>Gathered data and then developed Python scripts to train our binary classification algorithms on. We focused on simpler machine learning algorithms like decision trees, Naive Bayes,
	and Logistic Regression due to them being light weight and easily transferable to firmware with a small code and memory footprint.</h5>
	<h5>Investigated different machine learning algorithms and their respective cross validated accuracies. After chosing our primary 2 algorithms I investigated improvements
	to the algorithms by visualizing the data and trying to fit different distributions to the data to improve the 10-Fold cross validated accuracy.</h5>
	
	<h3>System Modeling using Particle Swarm Optimization</h3>
	<h5>Using Matlab and Python, developed a program that minimized the Root Mean Square Error of our model using gathered data</h5>
	
	<h3>Test Automation of Industrial Equipment</h3>
	<h5>Controlled a variety of machines using Python such as power supplies,multimeters,and industrial thermal chambers both through serial port interfaces and through TCP/IP </h5>
	
	<h3>Database Improvements and Interfacing</h3>
	<h5>Made a graphical user interface in Python to easily input data into which interfaced with a database through Django and SQL Alchemy</h5>
	<h5>Developed and added to a program in Python which had functions that queried the database and returned the requested data or information </h5>
