This is my blog where I document my dive into different topics, such as: machine learning, software engineering, edge AI, etc. My background is in Electrical Engineering and I have a masters degree in computer vision where I focused on medical imaging. I have a variety of experience developing deep learning models for pharmaceutical applications as well as for autonomous vehicle related applications.

<strong>Machine Learning Engineer</strong> (May 2020 - October 2021) \\
<strong>UBC CryoEM Lab (now Gandeeva Therapeutics)</strong>
- Developed deep learning models(pytorch) for cryo electron microscopy images based on architectures such as Resnet, UNet, and SqueezeNet for image classification, image segmentation, and object detection.
- Developed a multi-head model to perform several tasks simultaneously and utilized the common base layers between tasks to improve the quality of the outputted classes and images.
- Implemented an Apache Kafka based pipeline for high throughput inference on TB's of data every day utilising multi GPU servers.
- Leveraged research published in Arxiv to improve methods for layer normalization, optimizer algorithms, and network architecture to produce more robust models that converged faster.
- Developed web-based tools using python and Flask for data visualization and annotation for deep learning models.

<strong>Software Engineer Intern</strong> (May 2019 - August 2019) \\
<strong>Arista Networks</strong> (python/c++)
- Improved performance at scale by 10% for IP Tunneling as well as wrote tests to ensure proper functionality and check edge cases in unit tests.
- Extended functionality that controlled packet access to ports and to select routes for redistribution into routing domains into both the CLI and EosSdk to allow users to configure their networks manually or through agents.
- Worked on software releases and working on bug-fixes for product tests.

<strong>Research Engineer Intern</strong> (Jan 2018 - December 2018) \\
<strong>Cadex Electronics</strong> (python/c)
- Developed and implemented machine learning algorithms using Python and interfaced with database using SQL and libraries such as Django.
- Developed firmware for DSP applications using an ARM Cortex M7(STM32). Also worked on developing code and interfacing with peripherals such as high frequency pwm generation, timers and ADC's.
- Created a GUI using Python and PyQt5 which integrated multi-threading for the control of industrial test equipment and made an easy to use UI for others to use.
- Developed and assessed different machine learning algorithms to determine a battery's state of health within 5% and integrated it into the product's firmware

### Education
